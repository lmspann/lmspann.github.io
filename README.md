## About
With five years of professional experience implementing large scale SAP solutions for clients across industries with Deloitte Consulting, 
documentation is a step in the software development life cycle that I connecte with the most. 
Conducting research and creating comprehensive documentation for diverse stakeholder audiences gives me the opportunity to 
learn new technologies like a writer. 

The intersection of my professional experience and personal interest, solution implementation consulting and creative writing, makes technical 
writing an engaging career path for me.

## Purpose
This website serves as a portfolio for my technical writing projects. The Content section contains links to writing samples that I maintain 
with the GitHub and Swagger platforms.
