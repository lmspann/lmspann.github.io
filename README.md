# Technical Writing Portfolio

## About
With five years of professional experience implementing SAP solutions with Deloitte Consulting, documentation is a step in the software
development life cycle that excites me the most. Exciting may be a strong word, but doing research and creating comprehensive documentation for 
diverse stakeholder audiences gives me the opportunity to learn new technologies like a writer. 

The intersection of my professional experience and personal interest, solution implementation consulting and creative writing, makes technical 
writing an engaging career path for me.

## Purpose
This website serves as a portfolio for my best technical writing projects. The Content section contains links to writing samples that I maintain 
with the GitHub and Swagger platforms.
