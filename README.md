# Technical Writing Portfolio

## About
With five years of professional experience implementing SAP solutions with Deloitte Consulting, documentation is a step in the software
development life cycle that excites me the most. Exciting may be a strong word, but doing research and creating comprehensive documentation for 
diverse stakeholder audiences gives me the opportunity to learn new technologies like a writer. The intersection of my professional experience,
solution implementation consulting, and my personal interst, creative writing, makes technical writing an attractive career path.

## Purpose
This website serves as a portfolio for my technical writing projects. Below are links to writing samples that I maintain with the GitHub
and Swagger platforms.
